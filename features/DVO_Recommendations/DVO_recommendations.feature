Feature: Current way of presenting workload related recommendations is not good
    enough. As a customer using OCP Advisor I'd like to be able to consume
    Workload related recommendations grouped by namespaces. This means that new
    UX controls need to be added into Insights Advisor: it would split results
    of DVO recommendations per namespace and display it to end users.
    Notifications should also be sent per namespace (which would enable
    developers to gain access to results per namespace they own).
